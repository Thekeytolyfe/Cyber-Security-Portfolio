I am a Security+ certified professional in DFW with a background in operations leadership, now focused on SOC analysis and GRC compliance, building hands-on skills through projects and labs on TryHackMe.

## Objective

My journey in operations leadership and recent Security+ certification have fueled my passion for cybersecurity. I am eager to transition into the field by leveraging my skills in problem-solving, compliance, and hands-on labs, with the goal of joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as an Analyst or contributing in a GRC-focused role.
